# koa-react-starter
A starter kit with [Koa](http://koajs.com/) and [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/)!

This kit was inspired by [Koa-Starter](https://github.com/snollygolly/koa-starter)

## Prerequisites
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Version 5 and up recommended)
* [Github Client ID and Secret](https://github.com/settings/developers) (for OAuth)

### Installation

* Clone down the repository.
```
git clone https://github.com/cynical89/koa-react-starter.git
```

* Install packages (from inside the koa-starer folder).
```
npm install
```

* Create your config.  There's a `config.json.example` file in the root.  Edit it to include all your values for the site and your OAuth information.  Save it as `config.json` and leave it in the root.

* Start it up.
```
npm start
```

* Enjoy!
